  Examination Prepation p: Demand for private tutorials is ever increasing due to the increasing competition for higher education. To excel at national examinations such as SAT, International Baccalaureate and A-Level, students not only need to understand the subjects but also know the required examination techniques. Young Tutors believes that getting good examination grades is different from having a good knowledge of the subject. Young Tutors realises the importance of gaining both broad understanding of the subject and the skills required to excel in exams. 
  Examination Prepation p2: Edusia offers the perfect solution to finding the right tutor for students by connecting tutors and students from all education backgrounds and geography.
  Examination Prepation p3: More and more students and parents value the importance of international education and, therefore, the number of students going on study abroad in search for high-quality education is ever increasing. Almost a million students came to United States to study abroad in 2012-2013 school year with highest numbers from China, India, South Korea and Saudi Arabia. International students are going abroad with the ultimate goal of entering world renowned universities.
  
  Language Learning: Language Learning
  Language Learning p: Edusia believes that the best way to improve language speaking is to practice speaking in that language with a native speaker. Speaking can often be neglected in language courses with greater focus on reading and writing, perhaps because reading and writing can be studied by students themselves. For speaking practice, there are many language learning institutions working with native speakers to teach foreign languages but lessons from such institutions can be costly. Young Tutors offers a platform where language learners can meet native speakers for online chat lessons at an affordable price.
