      <h3>1. Post your tutor profile</h3>
      <p>Profiles are for you to tell students and parents about yourself who will be browsing through other tutor profiles. So make yours stand out!</p>
      <h3>2. Get in touch with students</h3>
      <p>Students will message you to discuss their needs and goals. Talk to them about how you can help them achieve their goals by designing and proposing your tuition plans.</p>
      <h3>3. Teach students online or in person</h3>
      <p>Once lessons are scheduled, it's time for you to meet your student online or in person and get down to tutoring. Help your students understand diffcicult concept, improve their grades and make a difference in their academic career!</p>
